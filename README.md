## Overview

_**Aniflix** is a fullstack application that allows users to browse a collection of animes. Authorized users have the ability to create, update, and delete animes which are associated with their individual accounts. Authorized users also get access to favorite animes and they can revisit them whenever they want to. This app utilizes Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL on the backend, and React.js on the frontend_

<br>

## MVP

-Create a SQL database with PostegreSQL to host all user/anime/category information

-Create full CRUD functionality for creating, updating, reading, and deleting anime information that was made by an authorized user

-User authentication and association to limit user interaction with the app's content

-Non-authorized routes for landing page and anime browsing, and authorized routes for creating and editing animes

<br>

### Goals

- _develop a deeper understanding of Ruby on Rails._
- _Learn TailwindCSS so I can utilize it in future projects._
- _Create a RESTfulish API_
